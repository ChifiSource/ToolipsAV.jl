More audio-video capabilities for toolips! I plan to eventually make this an extension primarily focused on streaming and easy customization for `Component{:video}` and `Component{Symbol("audio controls")}`. Don't expect this project to be done for a while, I am a bit busy with the thousands of other things, sorry friends.
